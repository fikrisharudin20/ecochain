# **Ecochain: A Decentralized E-Commerce Platform**

Ecochain is a decentralized e-commerce platform designed to reduce transaction fees, enhance transparency, and improve scalability using blockchain technology. By leveraging Ethereum Layer 2 solutions like Polygon, the platform ensures cost-effective and secure fund transfers for buyers, sellers, and store owners.

---

## **Features**
- **Low Transaction Fees**: Only 2% fee for store owners, with over 99% cost savings compared to traditional systems.
- **Scalability**: Processes over 1,000 transactions per second using Polygon.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback for invalid inputs and unauthorized actions.
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Secure and automated fund distribution among stakeholders.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Polygon (Layer 2)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Development Tools**: Ganache, Truffle
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript

---

## **Installation and Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ecochain.git
   cd Ecochain

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
   npm install

3. **Run Ganache for Local Blockchain**
    ```bash
    ganache-cli

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
    ```bash
    truffle migrate

5. Start the Frontend
    ```bash
    npm start

## **Usage**

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet to the platform.
2. Initiate transactions as a buyer, seller, or store owner.
3. Monitor transaction outcomes in real-time with reduced fees.

## **Discussion**
The Ecochain platform demonstrates the potential of blockchain in transforming e-commerce by achieving the following:

1. Interpretation of Results
- Cost Reduction: By using Layer 2 solutions like Polygon, transaction fees have been reduced significantly (e.g., $30 on Ethereum mainnet to $0.30 on Polygon).
- Scalability: The platform handles high transaction volumes efficiently using rollups.
- Error Handling: Provides clear error messages for unauthorized or invalid transactions, ensuring user confidence.

2. Limitations
- Dependence on Ethereum: While Layer 2 reduces costs, congestion on the Ethereum base layer can indirectly impact scalability.
- User Learning Curve: Non-technical users may struggle with blockchain wallet usage.
 -Security Concerns: Smart contracts are vulnerable to exploits; regular audits are necessary.
- Interoperability: Current implementation is limited to a single blockchain ecosystem.

3. Implications
Ecochain enables small businesses and independent sellers to access global markets at reduced costs. Its transparent fee mechanisms and blockchain-based security create a reliable e-commerce environment. Future advancements, such as decentralized identity systems and cross-chain compatibility, could further enhance the platform's versatility and adoption.

## **Team & Acknowledgements**
I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my amazing project partners: Shem, Uwais, and Darwin, for their hard work, collaboration, and dedication throughout the development of the Ecochain platform.

We also express our deepest gratitude to our supervisor, Dr. Uzma Jafar, for her invaluable guidance and support during this project.
